# Titanic-Insights-EDA

An interactive Python tool for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using a Tkinter-based GUI. This project allows users to load CSV files, visualize data, and generate insights through summary statistics, plots, and correlation heatmaps.

## Features

- **CSV File Upload**: Upload and load any CSV file for analysis.
- **Data Exploration**: Display first 5 rows, summary statistics, and handle missing values.
- **Visualization**: Generate bar plots for categorical variables, histograms/scatter plots for numerical variables.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualize correlations between numerical features.
- **Missing Values Detection**: Identify and display missing values in the dataset.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

> **Note:** `tkinter` is included with most Python installations by default.

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Insights-EDA.git
    cd Titanic-Insights-EDA
    ```

2. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python Titanic_eda_GUI.py
    ```

3. **Interact with the GUI**:
    - Use the buttons in the Tkinter window to upload a CSV file, view data, and perform EDA tasks.
